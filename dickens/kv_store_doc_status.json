The customer is paying $500 pe r month.\nAdara  - Reason for the difference in DSO 96 and adjusted DSO 96: -\n• Amounts outstanding to \"Big Village\" and \"Agencie Braque\" of $ 44k and $ 9k due to the company's liquidation (We have already  submitted our document for the \noutstanding amount to the liquidator.) \n•  The main reason for the increase in Adara DSO is majorly due to the Agencies customers. These customers normally have 60 -90 day s agreed payment terms \nhowever they only pay after the payment is received from the customer. Further, The ratio of Agencies vs Direct customers is around 65% - 70%.\n66Section 6: Others\n\n67Monetization\n\n68Orderbook YTD\nYear Opp Value 2023-24 2024-25 Orderbook 2023-24 2024-25\n2023-24 56,599,302$  35,125,108$  256,404$  21,217,790$  62% 63%\n2024-25 707,122 $       1,300 $          125,979$  579,843 $       0% 18%\nTotal 57,306,424$  35,126,408$  382,383$  21,797,633$  63% 62%Monetization % Consolidated Invoicing\nYear Opp Value 2023-24 2024-25 Orderbook 2023-24 2024-25\n2023-24 10,022,176$  4,934,083$    256,404$  4,831,689$    49% 52%\n2024-25 707,122 $       1,300 $          125,979$  579,843 $       0% 18%\nTotal 10,729,298$  4,935,383$    382,383$  5,411,532$    52% 50%RG Invoicing Monetization %\nYear Opp Value 2023-24 2024-25 Orderbook 2023-24 2024-25\n2023-24 46,577,126$  30,191,025$  - $       16,386,101$  65% 65%\n2024-25 3,356,368$    - $              - $       3,356,368$    0% 0%\nTotal 49,933,494$  30,191,025$  - $       19,742,469$  65% 60%ADARA Invoicing Monetization %\n•Adara revenue for Apr’24 is not closed yet\n69Travel Monetization (New Business): - \nTravelBI\nYear Opp Value 2023-24 2024-25 Orderbook 2023-24 2024-25\n2023-24 2,082,388$  1,089,396$  130,173$  862,819$     52% 59%\n2024-25 166,709$     - $            10,297$    156,412$     0% 6%\nTotal 2,249,097$  1,089,396$  140,470$  1,019,231$  59% 55%Invoicing Monetization %\nRev.AI\nYear Opp Value 2023-24 2024-25 Orderbook 2023-24 2024-25\n2023-24 569,120 $       161,428$    39,534 $        368,159 $      28% 35%\n2024-25 49,350 $         - $           - $             49,350 $        0% 0%\nTotal 618,470 $       161,428$    39,534 $        417,509 $      35% 32%Invoicing Monetization %\nCar\nYear Opp Value 2023-24 2024-25 Orderbook 2023-24 2024-25\n2023-24 450,986 $       335,175$    18,313 $        97,497 $        74% 78%\n2024-25 6,875 $           - $           761 $            6,114 $          0% 11%\nTotal 457,861 $       335,175$    19,074 $        103,611 $      78% 77%Invoicing Monetization %\nAir\nYear Opp Value 2023-24 2024-25 Orderbook 2023-24 2024-25\n2023-24 699,120 $       380,082$    49,914 $        269,124 $      54% 62%\n2024-25 8,500 $           - $           1,170 $          7,330 $          0% 14%\nTotal 707,620 $       380,082$    51,084 $        276,454 $      62% 61%Invoicing Monetization %\nOTA\nYear Opp Value 2023-24 2024-25 Orderbook 2023-24 2024-25\n2023-24 363,162 $       212,711$    22,412 $        128,039 $      59% 65%\n2024-25 101,984 $       - $           8,366 $          93,618 $        0% 8%\nTotal 465,146 $       212,711$    30,778 $        221,657 $      65% 52%Invoicing Monetization %\nKey order -book  Travel  BI:\n•Hotel Engine  ( PG OTA ) - (20k)\n•Cleartrip  Private Limited (PG OTA ) - (33k)\n•Sabre  ( PG OTA ) - (40k)\n•Thai Airways ( PG Air ) - (123k)\n•Alpha Group ( PG Air ) - (96k)\n•Avis Budget EMEA _Sixt Depth 2 Shopping (60k)\n•RevAI  - U Save & Green motion  (60k)\n•Rev-AI_Green  Motion Car &Van Rental South Africa (55k)\n70Hospi  BI Monetization : -\nHospiBI\nYear Opp Value 2023-24 2024-25 Orderbook 2023-24 2024-25\n2023-24 890,944$     618,250$    44,448$     228,247$    69% 74%\n2024-25 59,900 $       - $           26,639$     33,261$      0% 44%\nTotal 950,845$     618,250$    71,086$     261,509$    74% 72%Invoicing Monetization %\nRateParity\nYear Opp Value 2023-24 2024-25 Orderbook 2023-24 2024-25\n2023-24 175,132 $       124,318$    18,618 $        32,196 $        71% 82%\n2024-25 50,500 $         - $           24,650 $        25,850 $        0% 49%\nTotal 225,632 $       124,318$    43,268 $        58,046 $        82% 74%Invoicing Monetization %\nOptima\nYear Opp Value 2023-24 2024-25 Orderbook 2023-24 2024-25\n2023-24 715,812 $       493,931$    25,829 $        196,052 $      69% 73%\n2024-25 9,400 $           - $           1,989 $          7,411 $          0% 21%\nTotal 725,213 $       493,931$    27,818 $        203,463 $      73% 72%Invoicing Monetization %\nKey Order -book HospiBI :\n•Choice Hotels - Agoda Autofix  part \n3 for Radisson (30K)\n•Choice Hotels International - CLRP \nAddtl  bookings (7.2k)\n•Open -Room, Mallorca, Spain - \nOptima –(8k)\n•Sonesta Properties (35K)\n71RezGain  Monetization : -\nMost of the integration deals are pending from 22 -23, 23 -24\n•The $250k order book related to FY22 & FY23 is primarily related to integration deals - discussed it with Vikram Syal and they are working on it – \nit will be gradually cleaned up\n•JACIDI - RezGain  - RezGain  Basic : $ 13K;
