EBITDA  is \nreported  at $9.67mn, compared  to the $9.94mn budgeted,  marking  a 2.7% shortfall  primarily  due to lower  distribution  performance,  largely  attributed  to AWS  costs . \nThe EBITDA  margin  for YTD FY25 is 19% of gross  revenue\n✓In August,  with Adara  included,  gross  revenue  was $10.34mn, achieving  a gross  margin  of 71% and an EBITDA  of $2.19mn. Costs  were  better  than forecasted  across  \nall departments . The company  is performing  well in key revenue  streams  such  as DaaS  and MarTech , demonstrating  strong  year-over-year growth . However,  the \ndecline  in new bookings  is a concern  and will require  close  monitoring .\nAdara :\n✓Adara  estimated  revenue  for Aug’24 is $4.2mn with 65% GM and $930k EBITDA .\nDaaS :\nDaaS  Aug revenue  was entirely  in line with the forecast . Car & Air outperformed  the forecast  which  is offset  by OTA decline .\n✓New bookings  were  off by 45% which  is an area of concern . With $2.4mn new bookings  to date; we’re  down  by 9% in new bookings  Y-o-Y basis . \n✓$400k YTD revenue  downtick  from the budget  is entirely  offset  by favourable  YTD costs  from the budget . Also,  Revenue  growth  is higher  than cost growth\n✓EBITDA  for Aug ‘FY25 exceeded  the forecast  by 9%, indicating  strong  profitability . YTD EBITDA  is entirely  in line with the budget  showing  overall  good  performance ;  \nYTD EBITDA  at $4.1mn (Act)  v/s $4.1 (Bud) ; INLINE . \nTravel  BI:\nTravel  BI’s August  revenue  of $2.09mn aligned  with the forecast ; Car & Air outperformed  which  was offset  by a decline  in OTA revenue .\n✓Data  cost was lower  due to a lower  Travelport  bill following  successful  negotiation . Also,  the excess  provision  from July was reversed  in August ; Proxy  cost was higher  \ndue to – Google  consuming  high proxies  due to increased  requests,  a major  load moved  on to Premium  proxies  from fixed,  and PX2 captcha  solution  for priceline .com - \n$3.5k per month  (approved  recently)\n✓Expenses  were  lower ; by $58k as we see savings  across  all departments .

This shortfall is m ajorly contributed by lower \nenterprise connectivity revenue, while RZ and UNO revenue met expectations\nRZ\n✓Rezgain  August revenue was in line with the forecast, although billing from OYO remains lower than anticipated ($33k budgeted vs. $23k actual for Au gust 2024).\n✓Overall  expenses  are in line with forecast,  except  for Sales  expense  due to re-seller  commission  paid to Reconline  ($6k)\n✓Aug-24 EBITDA  stand  at negative  $17k act v/s forecast  of negative  $26k (an improvement)\nEnterprise  Connectivity\n✓Aug revenue  of $1.56mn is marginally  lower  than the forecast  mainly  due to lower  OTA volume  (Hotwire  & DER)  and lower  one-time revenue  recognition  for Amadeus  \n(which  was deferred  to next month ). This shortfall  was partially  offset  by an increase  in GDS  volume  (majorly  due to Marriott  & Hyatt)\nMartech  (Ex. Adara)\n✓For August  2024 , revenue  excluding  Adara  was approximately  $965k, falling  short  of the forecast  by $53k. BCV revenue  was 9% below  forecast  ($40k short),  while  MHS  \nnet revenue  was down  by 2% ($13k short ) from forecast .\nBCV\n✓BCV reported August revenue of $395k against the forecast  of $436k, The decrease in revenue was primarily due to no One-Time -Upsell revenue against a forecast of \n$25k and no new sales revenue from August sales. The New sales closed in Aug’24 of $149k  will have the revenue start from Oct’24 onwards . Other overhead costs – \nhad savings in Sales (low T&E expenses), Marketing, HR & Finance, and an SMM credit of $4k restricting the EBITDA loss to $29k even with a $41k drop in revenue .\nMHS\n✓Net revenue  (GOI)  for August  was $568k; YTD August  FY’25 GOI at 46%. MHS  Aug.’24 revenue  is lower  by $13k compared  to forecast  due to lower  ad revenue .\n✓MHS  August  EBITDA  is at $60k vs. forecasted  EBITDA  of $64k driven  majorly  by the decline  in revenue .\n✓YTD Aug FY25 EBITDA  is lower  by $122k in comparison  to Budgeted  EBITDA  and down  by $172k in comparison  to YTD Aug. FY24 actual  EBITDA  due to Novum  churn . \n6\nGrowth and Margins Snapshot (YTD ‘2025)\nREVENUE \nGROWTH\nPAT\nMARGINS\nREVENUE \nMIXNEW \nCONTRACT \nWINS\nCASH\nRESILIENT\nREVENUE- Collections : $9,537k (down $2.3mn) \n- Cash: $130,480k\n- ROI:  6.86% (Aug -24)\n- DSO: 68 Days (Jul -24)\n- GRR: 92%\n- NRR: 102%New contracts wins (YTD) : 6.62% (Y-o-Y)*\nBy segment:\n- MarTech :  44%\n- DaaS:  36%\n- Distribution : 20%Gross margins:  70%\nYTD EBITDA: $9,673k  (18.8%)Gross Revenue : $51,362k  (+14% Y-o-Y)\nBefore ESOP expenses.\n*Excluding Adara\n7Operational Metrics – Snapshot\n3,258\nCustomers (inc.

Overall  costs  were  entirely  in \nline  against  the forecast  across  all business  verticals . \n✓YTD’ 25, gross  revenue  stands  at $95.3mn,  reflecting  a 12% increase  from  the previous  year  but falling  short  of the $102 mn budgeted  target . EBITDA  is reported  at $19.04mn,  \ncompared  to the $21.48mn budgeted,  marking  an 11% shortfall  primarily  due  to overall  lower  revenue  & distribution  performance,  largely  attributed  to AWS  costs . The  \nEBITDA  margin  at YTD  FY25 is 20% of gross  revenue . \n✓ 3Q  Revenue  & EBITDA  (incl . IHG  & ESOP ) stands  at $33mn & $6.97mn (i.e., 21.1%). In INR  terms ; Rev  278 .6 Cr & EBITDA  59 Cr. These  are subject  to change  after  Stat  Entries\nAdara :\n✓ Adara  estimated  revenue  for Dec’ 24 is $5.1mn Gross  Revenue  with  63% GM and  ~$1.3mn EBITDA .\nDaaS :\nDaaS DEC revenue was better by $200k against the forecast due to AGODA's past minimum billing leftover for Sep -Nov.\n✓ YTDFY 25 New  bookings  were  off by 40% and  is an area  of concern . With  $4.9mn this  year ; we’re  down  by 30% in new  bookings  Y-o-Y basis . \n✓ Dec  Costs : Inline  with  the forecast  but COGS  were  higher ; which  were  offset  by savings  in other  departments\n✓ EBITDA  for Dec’ 24 was  better  than  the forecast ; $1.54mn (actual)  versus  $1.34mn (forecast) , resulting  in an excess  of $196 k for December . YTD  EBITDA  is off from  the \nbudget  by 6%;  YTD  EBITDA  at $8.2mn (Act)  v/s $8.7 (Bud) ; YTD  Margins  are at 37%; a 13% growth  on a Y-o-Y basis .\nTravel  BI:\n✓ YTDFY 25 revenue  growth  stands  at 15% & off from  the budget  by 5%. Lower  new  bookings  & contraction  in existing  accounts  like  Agoda  & Klook  are the key reasons .\n✓ Dec  Costs : Inline  with  the forecast  but COGS  were  higher  (see  below) ; which  were  offset  by savings  in other  departments  :\n•Hosting Costs: There was an increase of $10k from the last month, which was due to an increase in Data lake expenses by $5k and $5k higher overages of Wasabi. \n•Data Costs: Higher by $8k due to Skyscanner shops related to the Expedia Air project.\n✓ Other  expenses  were  mostly  in line  with  the forecast . On a YTD  basis , we’re  3% better  in overall  expenses  compared  to budget .\n✓ EBITDA  for Dec’ 24 was  better  than  the forecast ;$1.49mn (actual)  versus  $1.3mn (forecast),  resulting  in an excess  of $192 k for December . YTD  EBITDA  is off the budget  due  to \nlower  OTA  revenue ;  YTD  EBITDA  at $7.89mn (Act)  v/s $8.68 (Bud)\n5Executive Summary\nHospi  BI:\nHospi  BI Dec  ’24 revenue  was  as per the forecast,  with  EBITDA  at $53k. \n✓ The  data  cost  and  hosting  costs  are in line . Proxy  costs  will now  trend  at a higher  cost  ($15k this  month  vs $11k last  month) , due  to the movement  of the Booking  website to OXY  labs  (premium  proxy ) \ndue  to strict  IDeaS  SLAs ;  YTD  Dec  EBITDA  is at $298 k vs. the 24k budgeted .\nDistribution\n✓Dec’FY 25, the total Distribution  revenue  (Excluding  IHG)  is reported  at $1.65mn, which  is higher  than the forecast  of $1.58mn mainly  due to better  than forecasted  revenue  in UNO  & RZ \nbusiness  whereas  the Enterprise  connectivity  business  is at par with the forecast\nRZ\n✓Dec-24 revenue of $367k is better against the forecast of $312k,  better by $55k mainly due to catch up billing for few clients whereas cost was par to the forecast\n✓Overall  expenses  are at par to the forecast,  higher  Sales  expenses  due to reseller  commission  which  was offset  by lower  AM & PMG  expenses\n✓Dec 24 EBITDA  $36k act v/s forecast  of negative  $19k; YTD burn is better  at negative  $148k vs. negative  $184k budgeted  \nEnterprise  Connectivity\n✓Dec revenue  of $1.2mn is at par to the forecast,  OTA & GDS  volume  was slightly  higher  than the forecast  which  was offset  by delayed  monetization  on one-time projects   \nUNO\n✓Dec-24 revenue  of $87k is higher  by $14k against  the forecast  (includes  $50k one time revenue,  $31.5k from fastpay  long integration  overdue  payment  & $19k from H world  for Jun-24 invoice)  \n- Monthly  revenue  run rate is still below  $40k. Expenses  are fine, Hosting  increased  due onboarding  of RezGain  properties  to UNO,  which  increased  load by 10x, resulting  in higher  GCP  \ncost. Optimizations  are done,  anticipate  a reduction  in infrastructure  costs  in the coming  months\n✓YTD FY25 EBITDA  is (-$813k) vs. the budgeted  (-$826k) mainly  due to lower  revenue\nMartech  (Ex. Adara)\n✓For December  2024 , revenue  excluding  Adara  was ~$912k, up by $82k. Demand  Booster  revenue  was up by $66k due to recognition  of pending  deferred  revenue  and BCV revenue  was up \nby $16k on account  of true-up billing  of Margaritaville  account\nBCV\n✓BCV reported Dec. revenue of $392k against the forecast  of $377k up by $16k  with GM of 29% and EBITDA of $19k  vs -$14k. Primary reason for positive EBITDA is higher revenue and the \nsavings that we had in Marketing due to  Geletka  subscription being discontinued and SMM credit of  $12k.  These savings were partially set off by higher Freelancer and T&E expenses.\nDemand  Booster\n✓GOI for Dec was $602k; YTD FY’25 GOI at 46%. Dec.’24 revenue is better by $66k  compared to forecast due to additional revenue booked for $80k out of long pending deferred revenue.\n✓WIHP  costs have doubled i.e., from $10k pm in FY24 to an average of $22k pm in FY25 – proposal received from Cendyn  is under review/discussion by Yogeesh (potential savings expected \nis $3 -4k per month)\n✓Dec. YTD FY25 EBITDA  is lower  by $369k in comparison  to the Budgeted  EBITDA  and down  by $511k; on a Y-o-Y basis  due to Novum  churn .\n6\nGrowth and Margins Snapshot (YTD 9M ‘2025)\nREVENUE \nGROWTH\nPAT\nMARGINS\nREVENUE \nMIXNEW \nCONTRACT \nWINS\nCASH\nRESILIENT\nREVENUE- Collections : $9,661k\n- Cash: $141,499k\n- ROI:  6.74% (Dec -24)\n- DSO: 73 Days (Nov -24)\n- GRR: 90%\n- NRR: 98%New contracts wins (YTD) : (26.63)% (Y-o-Y)*\nBy segment:\n- MarTech :  45%\n- DaaS:  35%\n- Distribution : 20%Gross margins:  70%\nYTD 9M EBITDA: $19,036k  (20%)Gross Revenue : $95,332k  (+12% Y-o-Y)\nBefore ESOP expenses.& IHG Revenue\n*Excluding Adara\n7Operational Metrics – Snapshot\n3,123\nCustomers (inc.

Also,  we’re  able to save  costs  under  Data  due to Skyscanner  & Travelport\n✓GAAP  EBITDA  for July '24 exceeded  the forecast  by 4%, indicating  strong  profitability . YTD EBITDA  is slightly  below  budget  by 2%, showing  overall  good  financial  \nhealth  with room  for improvement ;  YTD EBITDA  at $3.2mn (Act)  v/s $3.28 (Bud) ; marginally  lower . \nTravel  BI:\n✓Travel  BI revenue  of $1.93mn was 3% below  the $1.99mn forecast,  primarily  due to OTA revenue  being  lower  by $50k \n✓July INFRA  shows  initial  signs  of efforts  being  made  to optimize  both Air & Car Hosting  costs . Also,  we’re  able to save  costs  under  Data  due to Skyscanner  & \nTravelport,\n✓Expenses  were  lower ; by $65k primarily  due to lower  INFRA  costs  & reversal  of excess  provisioning  for sales  commissions . On a YTD basis,  total costs  were  better  \nby $200k\n✓Y-o-Y revenue  growth  of +22% and EBITDA  of $3mn vs. $2.6mn last year\nHospi  BI:\n✓Hospi  BI July’24 revenue  is in line with the forecast,  however,  YTD July revenue  is up by $200k+ resulting  in a YTD EBITDA  of 157k vs budget  loss of -128k.\n✓With GMs  at 76% vs 73%, due to optimization  in the hosting  & Data  cost.\n5Executive Summary\nDistribution\n✓For Jul.’24, Distribution revenue (Excluding IHG) is reported  at $1.95mn which is marginally higher than the forecast of $ 1.94mn (Majorly contributed by higher \nenterprise connectivity which was partially offset by lower revenue in channel manager business, UNO revenue was at par to th e forecast )\nChannel Manager\n✓Revenue is lower than the forecast mainly due to the lower billing in the OYO account ($33k in forecast Vs $23k actual in Jul -24)\n✓Overall  expenses  are in line except  for Hosting  cost which  is high due to a month  lag in invoices,  The actual  Jul-24 bill is at $85k & Aug-24 will be below  $75k – Lower  \nhosting  expenses  will reflect  from next month  \n✓Jul-24 EBITDA  negative  $44k act v/s forecast  of negative  $11k\nEnterprise  Connectivity\n✓Jul revenue  of $1.6mn is higher  than the forecast  mainly  due to GDS’s  increased  volume  (majorly  due to Marriott)  which  was partially  offset  by lower  other  revenue\nMartech  (Ex. Adara)\n✓Jul’24 revenue  (ex. Adara)  was reported  at ~$1.1mn, $73k lower  against  the forecast . BCV revenue  for Jul’24 was up by 4% ($18k) and MHS  Net revenue  was down  by \n12% ($91k)\nBCV\n✓BCV NORAM  reported  revenue  of $442k, $18k up from the forecast  with GM of 23% and EBITDA  of -$31k against  the forecast  of -$50k due to higher  revenue .\nMHS\n✓Net revenue  (GOI)  for July was $636k; YTD July FY’25 GOI at 47%. MHS  Jul.’24 revenue  is lower  by $91k compared  to forecast  due to Novum’s  one-time billing  for \n$79k (EUR  72k) which  is not billed  in July. The customer  has asked  to bill the same  in Jan.’25 or waive  off completely  if they bring  us business  again  through  IHG.\n✓MHS  May EBITDA  is at $92k vs. forecasted  EBITDA  of $191k driven  majorly  by the decline  in revenue .\n✓However,  YTD July FY25 actual  EBITDA  is up by $52k in comparison  to Budgeted  EBITDA\n6\nGrowth and Margins Snapshot (YTD ‘2025)\nREVENUE \nGROWTH\nPAT\nMARGINS\nREVENUE \nMIXNEW \nCONTRACT \nWINS\nCASH\nRESILIENT\nREVENUE- Collections : $11,855k \n- Cash: $129,011k\n- ROI:  6.73% (Jul -24)\n- DSO: 71 Days (Jun -24)\n- GRR: 92%\n- NRR: 105%New contracts wins (YTD) : 5.40% (Y-o-Y)*\nBy segment:\n- MarTech :  44%\n- DaaS:  36%\n- Distribution : 20%Gross margins:  70%\nYTD EBITDA: $7,333k  (18.0%)Gross Revenue : $40,855k  (+20% Y-o-Y)\nBefore ESOP expenses.\n*Excluding Adara\n7Operational Metrics – Snapshot\n3,248\nCustomers (inc.

Overall  costs  were  in line  with  the \nforecast . However,  Marketing  (due  to the WTM  event)  & Infra  costs  were  slightly  higher,   Detailed  reasoning  is on the respective  BU slide .\n✓YTD’ 25, gross  revenue  stands  at $83.9mn,  reflecting  a 12% increase  from  the previous  year  but falling  short  of the $90.2mn budgeted  target . EBITDA  is reported  at $16.1mn, \ncompared  to the $18.6mn budgeted,  marking  a 13.6% shortfall  primarily  due  to overall  lower  revenue  across  all business  verticals . The  EBITDA  margin  at YTD  FY25 is 19.2% \nof gross  revenue . \nAdara :\n✓ Adara  estimated  revenue  for Nov’ 24 is $5.2mn Gross  Revenue  with  62% GM and  ~$1.3mn EBITDA .\nDaaS :\nDaaS Nov revenue was mostly in line with the forecast. \n✓ YTDFY 25 New  bookings  were  off by 46% and  is an area  of concern . With  $3.9mn this  year ; we’re  down  by 14% in new  bookings  Y-o-Y basis . \n✓ Nov  COGS  exceeded  the forecast  as we assumed  full savings  from  the INFRA  release  from  the Booking  POC  but servers  were  used  for the initial  week ; hence  we need  to pay  \nfor the full month  (Savings  will reflect  from  December) . However,  we did see  some  savings  from  last  month\n✓ EBITDA  for Nov’ 24 was  lower  than  the forecast ; $648 k (actual)  vs. $681 k (forecast) , resulting  in a shortfall  of $33k for November . YTD  EBITDA  is off from  the budget  by 9%;  \nYTD  EBITDA  at $6.65mn (Act)  v/s $7.3 (Bud) ; YTD  Margins  are at 35%; a 13% growth  on a Y-o-Y basis .\nTravel  BI:\nTravel BI  Nov revenue was marginally better than the forecast: \n✓ YTDFY 25 revenue  growth  stands  at 16% & off from  the budget  by 7%. Lower  new  bookings  & contraction  in existing  accounts  like  Agoda  & Klook  & high  Churn  in the NORAM  \nregion  are the key reasons .\n✓ Other  expenses  were  mostly  in line  except  AM and  marketing . AM was  higher  due  to travel  expenses,  and  Marketing  was  higher  due  to higher  costs  from  the WTM  event  \n(However,  overall  marketing  cost  is in line  with  budget)\n✓ EBITDA  for Nov’ 24 was  lower  than  the forecast ;$668 k (actual)  versus  $690 k (forecast),  resulting  in a shortfall  of $22k for November . YTD  EBITDA  is off the budget  due  to lower  \nOTA  revenue ;  YTD  EBITDA  at $6.4mn (Act)  v/s $7.3 (Bud)\n5Executive Summary\nHospi  BI:\nHospi  BI Nov ’24 revenue  was below  the forecast  resulting  in an EBITDA  loss of $21k; YTD Nov EBITDA  is at $246k vs. -$22k budgeted .\n✓Revenue  is down  (actual  $245k vs. forecasted  $265k); lower  revenue  is due to credit  notes  worth  $17k and a reduction  in share  from the Choice/Agoda  deal by 5k\n✓The data cost has been  reduced  to $8k and hosting  costs  are in line. Proxy  costs  will now trend  at 11k, due to the premium  proxy  for booking .com rate scrapping\nDistribution\n✓Nov’FY 25, the total Distribution  revenue  (Excluding  IHG)  is reported  at $1.82mn is marginally  lower  than the forecast  of $1.83mn mainly  due to lower  Enterprise  \nconnectivity  business  (GDS  volume  was lower  due to Thanksgiving  holidays)\nRZ\n✓Nov-24 revenue ($312k) is at par with the forecast, OYO revenue is trending at $19 -20k per month\n✓Overall  expenses  are lower  than the forecast  by $5k mainly  due to lower  expenses  in PMG\n✓Nov-24 EBITDA  is better  by 6k at negative  $12k v/s forecast  of negative  $18k; YTD burn is better  at negative  $184k vs. negative  $196k budgeted  \nEnterprise  Connectivity\n✓Nov revenue  of $1.46mn is marginally  lower  against  the forecast  of $1.48mn mainly  due to lower  GDS  revenue\nMartech  (Ex. Adara)\n✓For November  2024 , revenue  excluding  Adara  was ~$900k, falling  short  of the forecast  by $18k. BCV revenue  was 1% below  forecast  ($2k), while  Demand  Booster  net \nrevenue  was down  by 3% ($16k) from forecast .\nBCV\n✓BCV reported November revenue of $379k against the forecast  of $381k almost at par with $5k upsell in APMEA for Oberoi group ; BCV reported EBITDA of $67k  vs \nforecast of $69k . YTD EBITDA loss is $97k\nDemand  Booster\n✓Demand Booster Nov. EBITDA has fallen to a single digit ($2k) primarily due to declining month -on-month revenue (post -Novum) and the cost is stable at $500k per month \n(This is already highlighted by the FP&A team in the MBR) –FP&A recommendation: consider some cost rationalization measures to avoid the potential monthly loss\n✓WIHP  costs have doubled i.e., from $10k pm in FY24 to an average of $22k pm in FY25 – proposal received from Cendyn  is under review/discussion by Yogeesh (potential \nsavings expected is $3 -4k per month)\n✓Nov. YTD FY25 EBITDA  is lower  by $429k in comparison  to the Budgeted  EBITDA  and down  by $552k; on a Y-o-Y basis  due to Novum  churn\n6\nGrowth and Margins Snapshot (YTD ‘2025)\nREVENUE \nGROWTH\nPAT\nMARGINS\nREVENUE \nMIXNEW \nCONTRACT \nWINS\nCASH\nRESILIENT\nREVENUE- Collections : $9,484k\n- Cash: $139,939k\n- ROI:  6.84% (Nov -24)\n- DSO: 74 Days (Oct -24)\n- GRR: 90%\n- NRR: 99%New contracts wins (YTD) : (10.94)% (Y-o-Y)*\nBy segment:\n- MarTech :  45%\n- DaaS:  35%\n- Distribution : 20%Gross margins:  70%\nYTD EBITDA: $16,108k  (19.2%)Gross Revenue : $83,884k  (+12% Y-o-Y)\nBefore ESOP expenses.& IHG Revenue\n*Excluding Adara\n7Operational Metrics – Snapshot\n3,117\nCustomers (inc.

EBITDA  is reported  at $12.27mn, compared  to the $12.69mn budgeted,  marking  a 3.3% shortfall  primarily  due to lower  distribution  performance,  largely  \nattributed  to AWS  costs . The EBITDA  margin  for H1 FY25 is 19.5% of gross  revenue . Q2 EBITDA  Margins  before  Statutory  adjustments  (like ESOP ) stand  at 21.3%\n✓In Sep, with Adara  included,  gross  revenue  was $11.53mn, achieving  a gross  margin  of 72% and an EBITDA  of $2.85mn.

However,  the decline  \nin new bookings  is a concern  and will require  close  monitoring .\nAdara :\n✓Adara  estimated  revenue  for Sep’24 is $4.2mn with 63% GM and $846k EBITDA .\nDaaS :\nDaaS Sep revenue was entirely in line with the forecast. \n✓ 1HFY 25 New  bookings  were  off by 33% and  is an area  of concern . With  $3.5mn this  year , we’re  down  by 13% in new  bookings  Y-o-Y basis . \n✓ COGS  were  higher  due  to Booking .com  POC  cost  ($29k); Expedia  issues  for which  we moved  to premium  proxy  ($20k); Expedia  new  Skyscanner  project  ($14k) data  \nprocurement  cost ; Expedia  Priceline  website  captcha  cost  ($4k); IT & telecom  costs  were  higher  due  to Gong  License  costs  true -up for 8 months . This  is due  to a delay  in the \nvendor’s  invoice . \n✓ EBITDA  for Sep’ 24 was  in line  with  the forecast .

Out  of all BI products,  only  OTA  revenue  is behind  the budget  on an H1 basis .\n✓ EBITDA  for Sep’ 24 was  in line  with  the forecast .

Hospi  BI Sep’24 revenue  was 4% below  the forecast,  with an EBITDA  \nbeat of $28k vs $24k forecasted . YTD Sept EBITDA  is at $209k vs. -$67k budgeted  due to Scandic  one-time billing  and savings  on the data and proxy  cost\nDistribution\n✓Sep’FY 25, the total Distribution  revenue  (Excluding  IHG)  is reported  at $2.12 in line with the forecast  of $2.13mn; lower  CM & UNO  business  revenue  was partially  offset  \nby higher  enterprise  connectivity  business\nRZ\n✓Sep-24 revenue ($281k) is lower than the forecast by $26k mainly due to credit notes for integration deals ($18k), OYO ($5k) & S abre ($3k) \n✓Overall  expenses  are lower  than the forecast  by $21k mainly  due to savings  in Marketing  & SG&A  which  was partially  offset  IT & telecom  (true up of Gong license)\n✓Sep-24 EBITDA  negative  $33k act v/s forecast  of negative  $28k; YTD burn is better  at negative  $174k vs. negative  $221k budgeted  \nEnterprise  Connectivity\n✓Sep revenue  of $1.81mn is marginally  higher  against  the forecast  of $1.79mn mainly  due to higher  GDS  volume  (delay  in Hyatt’s  CRS  migration  had a positive  impact)\nMartech  (Ex.

The \nCOGS were high due to Video editing services non budgeted expenses  of $16.6k .\n✓BCV reported EBITDA of -$73k  in Sep’24 due to lower revenue and high COGS. YTD EBITDA loss in BCV is -$118k\nMHS\n✓GOI for September  was $535k; H1 FY’25 GOI at 46%. MHS  Sep.’24 revenue  is lower  by $62k compared  to forecast  due to a tracking  issue  for one of the clients  (this is \nrectified  now) ; MHS  September  EBITDA  at $44k vs. forecasted  EBITDA  of $74k driven  majorly  by the decline  in revenue,  partially  set-off by bonus  not accrued  due to low \nperformance .\n✓H1 FY25 EBITDA  is lower  by $162k in comparison  to Budgeted  EBITDA  and down  by $236k in comparison  to H1 FY24 actual  EBITDA  due to Novum  churn . \n6\nGrowth and Margins Snapshot (H1 ‘2025)\nREVENUE \nGROWTH\nPAT\nMARGINS\nREVENUE \nMIXNEW \nCONTRACT \nWINS\nCASH\nRESILIENT\nREVENUE- Collections : $10,854k (up $1.3mn) \n- Cash: $135,015k\n- ROI:  6.70% (Sep -24)\n- DSO: 71 Days (Aug -24)\n- GRR: 91%\n- NRR: 103%New contracts wins (YTD) : (5.87)% (Y-o-Y)*\nBy segment:\n- MarTech :  44%\n- DaaS:  36%\n- Distribution : 20%Gross margins:  70%\nH1 EBITDA: $12,276k  (19.5%)Gross Revenue : $62,813k  (+14% Y-o-Y)\nBefore ESOP expenses.\n*Excluding Adara\n7Operational Metrics – Snapshot\n3,093\nCustomers (inc.
