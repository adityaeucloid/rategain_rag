EBITDA  is reported  at $12.27mn, compared  to the $12.69mn budgeted,  marking  a 3.3% shortfall  primarily  due to lower  distribution  performance,  largely  \nattributed  to AWS  costs . The EBITDA  margin  for H1 FY25 is 19.5% of gross  revenue . Q2 EBITDA  Margins  before  Statutory  adjustments  (like ESOP ) stand  at 21.3%\n✓In Sep, with Adara  included,  gross  revenue  was $11.53mn, achieving  a gross  margin  of 72% and an EBITDA  of $2.85mn. Costs  were  better  than forecasted  across  all \ndepartments . The company  is performing  well in key revenue  streams  such  as DaaS  and MarTech , demonstrating  strong  year-over-year growth .
